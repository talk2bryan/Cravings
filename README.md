# Cravings
This is a group project for my HCI 1 class. I am collaborating with 3 other students and we are developing a website to help people find whatever restaurant that they are in the mood for.  The basic idea is this:  the user goes to our website and the website would approximate their location (or the user could choose his/her location).  Their location would appear on a map.  The user would see a list of types of food options in the area, or manually enter the type of food they want to eat.  The map would populate with the locations of all nearby restaurants as pins on a map and hide all other restaurants that don’t fit the criteria.  From there, the user could click on any one of the restaurant pins and bring up more information, such as aggregate review scores, average price of an entree, and some pictures of food.  If at any point the user changes his/her mind, they can go back, enter another food type, and continue searching.
